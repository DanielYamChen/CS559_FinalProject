This is the repo for the final project of CS 559: Computer Graphics in Spring 2021. I created an animated graphics town named the Forest Amusement Resort. It includes some basic features and advanced techniques in computer graphics. More details are listed below. This project uses JavaScript, Three.js, and GLSL.

## Features
### Living Area

- This place is for living and offers each group of customers an individual villa to live, along with a church.
- I show the techniques of using basic vertex-based geometries and picture-based texture rendering to make different kinds of buildings.

### Recreational Area

- One part is placed with unplugged instruments like a park, including the roundabouts, seesaws, and swings, which are suitable for children having leisured fun time in the afternoon. The other part is placed with plugged amusement facilities, including the rotating coffee cup, the ferris wheel, and a carousel, which are suitable for one-day joyable trip.
- I show the techniques of implementing various kinds of animated motions, such as vibrations seesaws and swings, two-ordered rotations in the coffee cup and the ferris wheel, and complicated motions like the carousel, and materialize fancy 3D stuff.

The last part is still under construction. The helicopter is busy collecting the woods in the forest. Visitors can also take the surrounding tourist train to admire the view of the whole resort. Besides, there are sometimes fireworks blooming in the sky.
