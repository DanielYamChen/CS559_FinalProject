Two kinds of objects created for this assignment:
1. FerrisWheel-0 - a ferris wheel made of the rotating wooden levers, some circular-moving cars, and a stoned support.

2. Rail-0 - a resort-surrounding train-and-rail set, which is made of some cars, a circle of single rail, a series of ties put aligned along the single rail. The cars run forward along the rail. The algorithm is mainly from my WB6, but the stereolization took me some effot allowed by the Piazza post,

Five other kinds of objects that you created:
3. CoffeeCup-0 - a rotating coffee-cup made of a rotating big platform, three rotating middle brown plates, and nine rotating wooden cups. This is modified from the example object, GrSimpleRoundabout, with a big difference from the original one.

4. Seesaw-0 - a seesaw made of one steel support, one wooden beam, and two wooden seats. This is from the "Exercise 2: Graphics Park" of my WB8.

5. CopterAndLog-0 - a helicopter collects logs and bring back the base. The helicopter is from the "Exercise 1: Quadcopter / Multi-Rotor" in my WB8.

6. Church-0 - a church made of some meshes and a texture. It is from the "Graphics Town Buildings (Exercise 4)" of my WB9.

7. House1-0 - a house made of some meshes and textures. It is from the "Graphics Town Buildings (Exercise 4)" of my WB9.

Vehicle: Rail-0
Natural Element: Tree-0
