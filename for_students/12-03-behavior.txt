Three different behaviors that you made:
1. rotation, such as "FerrisWheel-0", the things rotation along something.
2. translation, such as "Rail-0", cars move forward.
3. vibration, such as "Seesaw-0", a beam vibrating back-and-forth.

One behavior that is not simple:
Not simple: "Rail-0" - the cars move along a 2D Bezier's curve

Animated Articulated Figure:
Articulated: "CoffeeCup-0" - many things rotating along one another thing.
