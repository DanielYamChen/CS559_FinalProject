My town's theme is an amusement resort in the forest. Leave the troubles in the city and take a vacation for relaxatiion in the resort! This resort is departed into four parts. One part is for living, which offers each set of customers an individual villa to live, along with a church. One part is placed with unplugged instruments like a park, including the roundabouts, seesaws, and swings, which are suitable for children having leisured fune time in the afternoon. One part is placed with plugged amusement facilities, including the rotating coffe cup, the ferris wheel, and a carousel, which are suitable for one-day joyable trip. The last part is still under construction. The helicopter is busy collecting the woods in the forest. Visitors can also take the surrounding tourist train to admire the view of the whole resort. Besides, there are sometimes fireworks blooming in the sky.
